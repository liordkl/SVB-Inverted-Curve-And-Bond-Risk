Silicon Valley Bank (SVB), Inverted Curve And Bond Risk

You are wondering what the hell happened with Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) - it sounds like they didn't invest in any toxic assets like what happened in the 2008 Subprime Crisis. It appears that much of the problem was due to A) taking large deposits from startups and Venture Capitalists (who get large investment money from various sources for building highly innovative tech companies from scratch), then B) investing that money in bonds, and then C) losing money on those bonds when those depositors tried to take their money out. Most of these bond investments are (on the surface) "safe investments" - things like (US Government-backed) Treasury bonds and fairly safe Mortgage-backed securities (not the toxic subprime mortgage derivatives of the 2008 crisis). So what went wrong?
